## Downloading the Source Code
Give instructions on the different ways to get the required source code eg, git repo or from a website for the specific version of the source code that the students are required to do


## Building and Deploying
Let them know what to do after downloading, like navigating to the source directory and compiling with desired options:



# Benchmark 1:
This should be the simple "tutorial" type problem to ensure that the application or benhcmark is installed , built and deployed correctly. This can be a serial and/or parallel run, give basic commnads on how to achieve this.


# Benchmark 2: Larger Polymer System
This should be the main problem that needs to be solved, built and deployed correctly. Give basic commnads on how to achieve this.



# Visualization
If there is sime visualation that can be for the benchmark and problem, give the instructions here
```

# Submission

Details on what files to submit.
