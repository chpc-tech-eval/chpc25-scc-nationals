ASCOT5
===========

[ASCOT5](https://ascot4fusion.github.io/ascot5/index.html) (Accelerated Simulation Code for Tokamaks, version 5) is a high-performance test-particle orbit-following code for computing particle orbits in 3D geometry for fusion plasma physics and engineering. It solves minority species' distribution functions, transport, and losses in tokamaks and stellarators. It supports advanced physics models, multiple integration schemes, and parallel execution using MPI.

# Installation
ASCOT5 requires a functioning C compiler and libraries like MPI for parallel processin

# System Requirements
ASCOT5 requires a functioning C compiler and libraries like MPI for parallel processin. Below is a table of recommended minimum software versions that should be filled out:

# Downloading the Source Code
Give instructions on the different ways to get the required source code eg, git repo or from a website for the specific version of the source code that the students are required to do


## Building and Deploying
Let them know what to do after downloading, like navigating to the source directory and compiling with desired options:



# Benchmark 1:
This should be the simple "tutorial" type problem to ensure that the application or benchmark is installed , built and deployed correctly. This can be a serial and/or parallel run, give basic commnads on how to achieve this.


# Benchmark 2:
This should be the main problem that needs to be solved. Give basic commnads on how to achieve this.



# Visualization
If there is some visualisation that can be done for the benchmark and problem, give the instructions here.

# Submission
Details on what files to submit.
